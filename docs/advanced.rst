Advanced
=========

While the library aims primarily to expose a simple fitting API, its internal toolkit is useful and versatile for advanced applications. Here it is documented. The alternative way to learn how it operates is to view the sources for the simpler API. These are within `iirrational/v1/data2filter.py <https://github.com/mccullerlp/iirrational/blob/master/iirrational/v1/data2filter.py>`_ and its imports.

Please contribute if a new technique, parameterization, or simplification shows promise!
